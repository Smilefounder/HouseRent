<h2>Description </h2>
In our project we will try to keep some features that can help the user to find a perfect and comfortable home for them. We will keep a form that should be fill up by the owner of the house. The owners should give a detail information of his/her house.
The user can search according to location or area through the google map and can get the result how many homes are in one location. He or she can also find out the house if he/she is bachelor. We keep different categories such as family, female bachelor or male bachelor.
The user can acknowledge the rent information, facility bill information along with utility bills. Flat details can be provided with pictures or video. The user can get information about the owner through comments or review systems. The owner can also have the information about the tenant.
